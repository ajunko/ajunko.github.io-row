	<h1>General</h1>
		<p>The best place to get started is to look on the internet for what piques your interest about the sport. This website is a great starting point but there are other sources that may provide you with more context. Specifically, <a href="https://usrowing.org/">U.S. Rowing</a> is in charge of a majority of the rowing operations in the country and <a href="https://worldrowing.com/">World Rowing</a> is the worldwide leader of the sport and its many events.</p>
		
	<h2>Practice makes Perfect</h2>
		<p>If you have an interest in competing at a higher level within the sport, it is ideal that you attempt to learn from someone who is qualified in the sport. Look around for nearby club teams that may help you on your journey. In the local area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, some of the most notable teams include <a href="https://www.threeriversrowing.org/">Three Rivers Rowing Association</a>, <a href="https://www.sylvanscullers.com/">Sylvan Scullers</a>, and <a href="http://www.pittsburghrowingclub.com/">Pittsburgh Rowing Club</a>. Regardless of which club you choose, whether your decision is based on price, coaching staff, or simply where you live, all of these clubs will jumpstart your transition into the sport.</p>
		
	<h2>Regattas and Indoor Challenges</h2>
		<p>One of the best tests of your abilities is competing at a higher level. If you are looking to test your skills as you make improvements, take some time to look for nearby regattas on <a href="https://www.regattacentral.com/">Regatta Central</a> or <a href="https://www.herenow.com/#/home">HereNOW</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.concept2.com/">Concept2</a> sponsors indoor challenges and events if you are looking to compete on the ergometer in your off season.
